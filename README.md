# Database Initialization for Final Project

### Steps for development

In order to start this database, simply clone this github repo to your local machine.
<br><br>
Change your current directory into it. Then type `make up`.
<br><br>
Wait for a few minutes, then you should be able to access the database at `localhost:5050`.
<br><br>
Please refer to https://github.com/TendonT52/postgreSQL-pgAdmin-installation-guide to see how to access `pgAdmin`, starting from **installation step 6**.
<br><br>
After all those steps, a `testFinal` database should exist, along with all the tables and data.
<br><br>
If you have made some changes on the database's data and wish to restore the original one:

- simply type in `make restart` at the root directory of the repository
- wait for a few minutes
- then access `pgAdmin` again.
